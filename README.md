#  CocoMaster

## [ACCEPTED] APPLE - SWIFT STUDENT CHALLENGE WWDC22

## Description

CocoMaster is an application to learn and play about coconut and its derivatives. Users are challenged to find all coconut-derived products from one item which is the coconut tree. When the user successfully collects all of them, they will be awarded the title of CocoMaster.

This application has a drag and drops feature, where the user has to drag an available item and do something to it and decide whether to separate or process it. To find all coconut-derived products, the user must process all the items owned. However, not all items can be processed directly, some of which must be divided into several new items.

The main game view is divided into two sections. On the left is the scroll view where the user sees the items they have. On the right is the section where the user performs an action on the item and a box for accepting dropped items that have been dragged to be separated or processed. When the box receives an item, an action button and detailed information about the item will appear below it.

The application almost entirely uses the SwiftUI framework, it has been optimized for iPad Pro screen and users can enjoy landscape or portrait views. This app does not require an internet connection so it can be used anywhere. The code in the application has been made to make it easier to change the type of crop, so that this application can be used to explain derivative products from other agricultural commodities. To replace a new plant, you need to create data from other plants that match the shape of the existing data type.

This application is intended as teaching material for junior and senior high school students to make learning about agriculture more fun. In some remote areas in Indonesia, some agricultural commodities are not processed properly to have more added value. Mostly due to lack of information and market access. For that, I will explain more about the background of this application in the comments section.
